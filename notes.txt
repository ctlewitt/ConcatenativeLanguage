It feels wrong to give each function control of the stack instead of passing it variables.  Seems to be normal, though.
introspection
or write out (add, 2) which indicates having 2 parameters

python: inspect, get args back


play with stack based languages
forth
factor


This doesn't feel Turing complete yet--more like a programmable calculator.
Research what makes a language Turing complete.
