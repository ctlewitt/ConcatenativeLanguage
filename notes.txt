add comments for each function about parameters, actions, return values
update "compiler" references to "interpreter"
integrate input into tests
finish function tests
test certain stack functions
organize user added funtions
have all built in functions written in the language load automatically
add ability to comment inline in a function -- test this! &&& comment &&&
make sure that main interpreter reads clearly


Research what makes a language Turing complete.  Am I done yet?
