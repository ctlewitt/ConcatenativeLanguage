add comments for each function about parameters, actions, return values
update "compiler" references to "interpreter"
integrate input into tests
finish function tests
test certain stack functions
organize user added funtions
have all built in functions written in the language load automatically
add ability to comment inline in a function -- test this! &&& comment &&&
make sure that main interpreter reads clearly
load functions

potentially pull function execution/interpretation into function.py from concat_interpreter.py;
  need to use qualified import statements (see function.py)


finish refactoring tests (pull string into test, use assertStackEquals)




Research what makes a language Turing complete.  Am I done yet?

# todo: should check to make sure that function is not a number, boolean, etc
